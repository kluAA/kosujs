        <p>Quick instructions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Use the mouse to target the beats
            </li>
            <li>
                Press any key (traditionally "z" or "x") to hit the beat at the correct time
            </li>
            <li>
                The perfect time is when the outer shrinking circle reaches the same size asa the inner circle
            </li>
            <li>
                For sliders, hit the numbered beat, keep the key held down, and follow the moving yellow circle with your mouse
            </li>
            <li>
                Great timing = 300 pts, Normal = 100 pts, Ok = 50 pts
            </li>
            <li>
                Each consecutive great or normal hit will increase the combo multiplier by 1
            </li>
